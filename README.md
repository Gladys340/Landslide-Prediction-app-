# Landslide-Prediction-app-
This is a machine learning app to predict if a landslide will occur or not.

This project is based on an example of Hong Kong which is one of the hilliest and most densely
populated cities in the world.We now have employ machine learning techniques to help identify 
accurately if a landslide will occur or not because, the common practice of identifying landslides 
is visual interpretation which, however, is labor-intensive and time-consuming.
